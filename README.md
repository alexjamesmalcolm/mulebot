# M.U.L.E. Bot
mulebot is a Raspberry Pi library focused around the software that runs our robot the Mechanical Ultra high frequency Load Escort Bot as a part of our final engineering project at the Columbus State Community College. The goal of the project is to make a robot able to navigate around obstacles while pursuing a radio signal.

# Modules
Mulebot is going to be made up of 5 modules: power supply, electric drive system, radionavigation, echolocation, and the computer.

# Shopping List
The computer will be a Raspberry Pi Zero. They are currently out of stock so we’re going to wait until they’re being sold again and buy one. They sell for about $5. In order to store programs to be executed we’ll need a microsd card with an adapter for my computer
